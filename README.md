xbmc-rssalternative
===================

Play audio from a RSS stream with resume support.

At this point testing has been extremely limited. If something doesn't work as
expected, please turn on the xbmc debug log and report the issue together with
said log on github:
  https://github.com/squisher/xbmc-rssalternative/issues

Loosely based on the plugin.audio.npr.


Installation
------------

Easiest method: Download from http://de.mcbf.net/~squisher/xbmc-rssalternative/

Alternative:
* Rename the git directory to 'plugin.audio.rssalternative', then create an
  archive:
  $ zip -r plugin.audio.rssalternative-0.3.0.zip plugin.audio.rssalternative

In both cases you have to use XBMC's add-on 'install from ZIP file'.
