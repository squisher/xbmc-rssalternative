xbmc-rssalternative
===================

Play audio from a RSS stream with resume support.

At this point testing has been extremely limited. If something doesn't work as
expected, please turn on the xbmc debug log and report the issue together with
said log on github:
  https://github.com/squisher/xbmc-rssalternative/issues

Loosely based on the plugin.audio.npr.
